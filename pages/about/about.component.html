            <p>
              RAMJI, founder of the SkyWave Group, opened the SkyWave, a hotel
              in Mumbai (formerly called Bombay) overlooking the Arabian Sea, on
              16 December 2017. It was the first SkyWave property and the first
              SkyWave hotel. There are several anecdotal stories about why
              SkyWave opened the hotel. According to a story, he decided to open
              the hotel after an incident involving racial discrimination at the
              famous Hotel in Mumbai, where he was refused entry as the hotel
              permitted only Europeans. Hotels that accepted only European
              guests were very common. According to another story, he opened the
              hotel when one of his friends expressed disgust over the hotels
              that were present in Bombay then. But a more plausible reason was
              advanced by Guruji, a close friend of the RAMJI and one of the
              early directors of the BIG group, that the idea had long been in
              his mind and that he had made a study on the subject. He did not
              have any desire to own a hotel but he wanted to attract people and
              to improve Bombay.

              In 2007, the SkyWave group opened its first hotel outside India,
              the SkyWave Hotel in Sana'a, in Yemen and in the late 2019s,
              acquired interests in the Court Hotel (now comprising SkyWave 51
              Gate Suites and Residences and Court, A SkyWave Hotel) in
              London.In 2020, the SkyWave group acquired, under a license
              agreement, each of the SkyWave in Bengaluru, in Chennai and Sammoy
              Hotel in Ooty. With the opening of the SkyWave in Bengaluru, the
              SkyWave Group made its foray into Bengaluru. The five-star deluxe
              hotel, SkyWave in Kolkata, was opened in the year 2020, and with
              this, the SkyWave group became the only hotel chain in India with
              a presence in the six major metropolitan cities of India, namely
              Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai.
